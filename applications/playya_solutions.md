# Playya Solutions Application for VeChain General Grant

## Project Overview 

- Project: **Playya Solutions**, the strategic toolset for animation & gaming studios collaborating and trading digital assets.
- Team Name: Playya 
- Payment Address: 

### Overview

**Digital Media Creation** is undergoing a major disruption. Gaming and Animation studios are merging tools, processes and pipelines and are looking at new ways of **engaging with their audience** and **monetizing their IPs**. We think that what we call today NFTs will ultimately become the preferred vehicle for digital artists & consumers to engage, trade and collaborate. We believe in **p-2-p on-chain automation** and verification to create virtuous commercial interactions between professional creators & their audience and level the playing field between creators, big and small.

We are designing **Playya** to be a **curated web3 platform** and a **strategic partner** for **animation & gaming studios** and **indie creators**. The platform will provide **"No code" solutions** for taking advantages of **Web3 & NFTs technologies**. In particular: 

  1. Publishing and trading **digital assets as NFTs** on Playya's proprietary store, backed by **cost-efficient blockchain and wallet**
  2. Using **Smart contracts** to grant **in-game benefits** to players owners of their **IP related NFTs**,
  3. Engaging **collaboratively** with other creators and studios
  
To power Playya at the desired scale, we aim to pick a **sustainable and cost-efficient blockchain** with a solid track record in digital intellectual property services. By all accounts, we think that VeChain would be an optimal technology partner to help us create the conditions to make Playya thrive. 

### Project Details

Playya's first milestone, **Playya Market** (released in November 2022), is a curated marketplace designed for studios and creators to **trade digital assets**, **collaborate** and **complete their productions quickly**. Playya Market allows digital assets creators and IP owners **minting their creations into NFTs**, and selling them to studios.
The marketplace supports **on-chain NFT minting** using EVM compatible wallets, relying on Ethereum blockchain and Polygon. Playya Market also supports **off-chain minting**, allowing digital creators to launch new asset collections at no cost.

Playya's next milestone will be **Playya Lab**, a toolset for collaborating studios, including an innovative **smart contract editor**. Playya Lab will allow studios **creating smart contracts easily**, in order to **grant in-game bonuses and advantages** to NFTs owners playing their games and metaverses. The smart contract editor intends using **VeChain blockchain** for **smart contracts deployment**.

Another milestone consists in publishing a plugin for **NFT minting using VeChain (VET) wallet** for [Bubble.io](https://bubble.io/) apps. Allowing VET owners to mint, buy and sell NFTs using wallets such as **Sync2** and/or upcoming new **VeChain (VET) Wallet**  is an important milestone. Thanks to **VeChain blockchain platform**, Playya intends disrupting the current NFT market with **lower minting cost**, hence contributing directly to **VeChain technology ecosystem** and developing the NFT market across the world.

### Ecosystem Fit

There is an **increasing demand for a better solution** that provides a better guided experience and harnesses the **collaborative power of web3** for creative professionals in a trusted, sustainable and durable way. NFTs marketplaces are plagued by scams, frauds, bad UI and offer little to no protection to buyers & IP owners alike. All these factors do little to reduce the general public’s scepticism and hinder the mass adoption of NFTs by the general public. 

The current market of NFTs and smart contract heavily relies on EVM i.e. Ethereum based solutions. A consequence of this almost monopolistic situation is that NFT minting costs are still high, keeping many digital asset creators out of NFT markets. Playya's milestones aim to disrupt this by **reducing the cost of NFT minting and smart contract operations**. We intend using VeChain blockchain to implement this change, hence helping gaming studios and asset creators to collaborate more efficiently, and reducing the related CO2 emission charges.
